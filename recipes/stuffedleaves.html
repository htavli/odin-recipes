    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These grape leaves are stuffed with a tantalizing mixture of lemony rice and fresh herbs. 
        "Yum" is the only word to describe them! Serve them as an appetizer, or as a main dish paired with crusty bread and a Greek salad.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>White rice</li>
        <li>Grape leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add rice, onion, dill, and mint; saut√© until onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Pour in 1/2 of the broth, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until rice is almost cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in 1/2 of the lemon juice and remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Plunge grape leaves into a deep container of very hot water until soft, about 10 seconds; pat dry.</li>
        <li>Place a grape leaf onto a work surface with the shiny side facing down. Place 1 teaspoon rice mixture on leaf at the stem end; fold both sides in toward the center and roll up from the wide bottom to the top. Place stuffed leaf into a 4-quart pot. Repeat to stuff remaining leaves, packing them into the pot tightly so they don't open while cooking.</li>
